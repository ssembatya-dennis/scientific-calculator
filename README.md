## Overview

A beautiful, free online scientific calculator with advanced features for evaluating percentages, fractions, exponential functions, logarithms, trigonometry, statistics, and more.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the calculator depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive buttons on the calculator
- use the calculator to carry out all the alegbra expressions
- Use the calculator either in standard or scientific mode (include advanced operations)

## My process

- I began with setting up a basic file structure for the project and writing the markup and styling for the app without adding functionality to any button.

- Since I had no design document for the app I innitialy picked motivation from the windows calculator app but that didn't come off very well. I was later lone assisted with my mentor and adviced me to have a look at a normal Casio Scientific Calculator which I used as reference to build the UI of the app.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
